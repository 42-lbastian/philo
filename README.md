<h2 id="description_id"> Description of the project: </h2>

The goal of this project is to solve the classic problem of the philosophers. There are *n* philosophers around a table, a fork beetween each philosophers and a bowl of spaghetti in the middle.
For example if there is one philosopher, there is only one fork, and 3 if there are 3 philosophers.

Each has a time to eat, to sleep and must eat before starving. To eat they need both forks and when they done eating they must sleep.

<h2 id="usage_id"> Usage: </h2>

#### Compilation: (in the folder that contain the makefile)
```shell
make
```

How to run it:
```shell
./philo number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat_optionnal]
```
Where:
- *number_of_philosophers*: The number of philosophers and also the number of forks.
- *time_to_die* (in milliseconds): If a philosopher didnâ€™t start eating *time_to_die ms* since the beginning of their last meal or the beginning of the simulation, they die.
- *time_to_eat* (in milliseconds): The time it takes for a philosopher to eat. During that time, they will need to hold two forks.
- *time_to_sleep* (in milliseconds): The time a philosopher will spend sleeping.
- *number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat* (optional argument): If all philosophers have eaten at least number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat times, the simulation stops. If not specified, the simulation stops when a philosopher dies.
